</h1>
<h2> Here are Some of Our Tips For Reading.
</h2>
<p> 1. Can't Concentrate: Make sure you are in an enviroment that has no distractions.  Sometimes it helps if you are not in front of a TV, or listening to music.
</p>
<p> 2. Make Sure its a Book you Like: One problem that many people have is that the book they are reading isn't the right book for them.  If you find yourself not liking a book, thats OK! Just find a different book you enjoy, or if you heard its a good book, just hang in there!
</p>
<p> 3. Find Your "Reading Place": Find a place where it is comfy, has almost no distractions, and whatever else you want!  It can be a special chair, the family couch, your bed, a bench at the park, or anywhere that you like!
</p>
<p> If you find something that works for you, share it with friends and family.  A good idea is worth being shared!
